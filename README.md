## Host test server I used:
I used MongoDB's Atlas:
https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

## Once Downloaded:
Simply navigate to the main folder directory and initiate an npm install

```
npm install
```

this will install all the node modules needed for the application.


## Once downloaded and modules installed:
Go ahead and run the server by initiating the command line
```
npm start
```
this will initiate the nodemon server file.
